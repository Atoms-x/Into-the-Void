## About this Game
Into the Void is a Zelda-like isometric top down dungeon crawler following the hero as he descends into the Void, in search of the treasure that could bring peace to the world. Slash, dash, and fireball your way through the Void, the fate of the world rests in your hands! Fight through mobs of slimes, dodge the quick strikes of the mabbits, be wary of the range of the obelisks, and find gaps in the tough bark of the ents. Rumor has it that there might be even worse deeper down!

### Know your Enemy

#### Slimes

These slow moving, dim-witted creatures aren't particularly dangerous by themselves, but don't let that fool you! They come in great numbers and can quickly overwhelm you if you're not careful! Look out for the large slimes as well, they might have a trick or two.

#### Mabbits

They look like mice but jump like rabbits! They might seem docile at first, but they have a quick bite!

#### Ents

Ancient tree people, they are continous in their pursuit. Their bark is incredibly tough and they seem to be invincible from the front.

#### Obelisks

These towers appear to have been made by a people long lost. Be careful, though you might not be able to see them, they can see you and reach you too!

### Know Yourself

#### Slash - <kbd>Space</kbd>

The most basic of attacks, but your most certain one as well. Very low cooldown time and can dish it out so long as you're still alive

#### Dash - <kbd>Shift</kbd>

A quick way to get out of danger (or into it!). You only have a max of three in a row but they will refill over time

#### Fireball - <kbd>Caps Lock</kbd>

![Fireball](https://github.com/SgtR0ck/Into-the-Void/assets/8111664/aa75f027-0924-4511-a4d2-eb6786ea65b5)

Your long range attack, great for keeping your distance. Don't be too over zealous though, you're limited by your mana!
